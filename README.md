# Heart-Risk-Predictor-ML-Model

The proposed work is the construction of an ML model (could be a Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes etc.) which will read from existing heart disease-related datasets, and analyse all the independent variables.  After the testing-training data split, we predict the dependent variable of the testing data.  Later, we will compare the accuracy between the test set and the predicted values of the dependent variable.

Having a huge number of data, such as cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels, and even other behavioural data such as smoking history, and other prevalent health issues, this seemingly random data is streamlined into information that is fed into machine learning algorithms, to predict whether or not a person is risk-free.

 With proper visualization and various other accuracy metrics, we can correlate which variables are essential markers of predicting heart risk.</br> 
 ***WORKING***</br>
 The working of the system starts with the collection of data and selecting the important attributes. 
Then the required data is preprocessed into the required format. The data is then divided into two parts training and testing data.
 The algorithms are applied and the model is trained using the training data. 
The accuracy of the system is obtained by testing the system using the testing data. This system is implemented using the following modules.
      1.) Collection of Dataset 
      2.) Selection of attributes 
      3.)Data Pre-Processing 
      4.) Balancing of Data 
      5.) Disease Prediction
